Afterwards, you'll be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.Michael SullivanGood afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining Applied 's fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained and Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release, and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.Gary DickersonThank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for delivering the best year in Applied Materials ' history while navigating a dynamic and challenging environment. Demand for semiconductors and wafer fab equipment remains very strong. And in fiscal 2021, we generated $23 billion of revenue, which represents 34 % annual growth. In fiscal Q4, we hit the midpoint of our earnings guidance, despite larger than expected supply chain constraints. These constraints worsened in the last few weeks of the quarter, as we experienced delayed shipments from several suppliers. Without these supply shortages, we estimate that our Q4 revenues would have been at least $300 million higher.We expect supply chain headwinds to persist into fiscal 2022 and mitigating them remains our top priority. For this reason, I'll begin today's call by providing some additional details about the industry's supply dynamics, both near-term and longer-term. Next, I'll describe the demand outlook, which is very strong and broad-based. I'll then talk about the progress we're making against our growth strategy and how Applied Materials is positioned to outperform the market over the coming years. I'm also happy to welcome Bob back to the CFO seat while we conduct a search for our next CFO. Later in the call, Bob will share his perspective on the state of the business and provide color on our financial performance.So let me start with the supply side of the equation. Applied has made and continues to make strategic investments in our own global manufacturing infrastructure, so factory capacity is not a limiting factor for us. Like many in the industry, the primary challenge we face today, is availability of certain silicon components. For Applied, our issues are relatively narrow, and we are proactively collaborating with our suppliers and directly with the chip companies to find solutions or work around bottlenecks. I deeply appreciate their partnership and teamwork as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances together.Looking further ahead, I believe we will see permanent changes in the way supply chains are designed and operated. In the semiconductor industry and beyond, there's a shift from Just-in-time to a just-in-case approach which will require higher levels of inventory, more built-in redundancy, and more burst capacity. Because the economic value of capturing upside opportunities far outweighs pure efficiency savings, we're also seeing changes in supply agreements across the ecosystem as companies place a premium on having preferential access to capacity. In addition, our customers are providing us with longer-term visibility and we're collaborating more closely than ever when it comes to capacity planning. On top of that, the strategic importance of semiconductors is now recognized at a national level.Over the next few years as incentive programs become available in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, we expect to see a trend towards regionalized supply chains that are more resilient, but also increase capital intensity. Now, I will characterize the demand environment, which is extremely healthy. The pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of the economy, fueling semiconductor consumption, and driving the need for next-generation silicon technologies. As a result, we see wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2021 up around 40 % year-on-year. In other words, in the mid $80 billion range and constrained by supply, not demand. There is still a long way to go before supply and demand is balanced, especially as demand drivers continue to grow. We therefore expect wafer fab equipment spending to be up again in 2022.While we're currently focused on resolving near-term challenges, it's important to recognize we're only at the beginning of major technology and market inflections that will play out over the next decade. As everything gets smarter from our phones to our cars, to our homes, we see a combination of unit growth and increasing silicon content per unit. For example, if you look at this year's high-end smartphones, by dollar value, the application process or semiconductor content is up about 20 % compared to last year's models. And RF content increased at twice that rate. And in data center applications, the average DRAM and NAND content per server is also growing at a 20 % compound annual growth rates. As more and more smart devices are connected at the edge, they are driving exponential growth in machine generated data that must be stored, moved, and processed.Then, to create value from these vast volumes of data, new AI computing approaches are being developed, fueling further demand for current and next-generation semiconductors. When I talk with customers, their message is clear and consistent. They are investing strategically to be in the best position to capture value as these long-term secular trends accelerate. In our core market, Foundrylogic is about 60 % of wafer fab equipment spending in 2021. And we expect it to remain at this level or higher over the next several years. Within Foundrylogic, the spending mix is relatively balanced between the most advanced nodes, where we see a fierce battle for leadership playing out in ICAPS.ICAPS nodes serve the fast-growing IOT communications, automotive, power electronics, and sensor markets. In memory, supply and demand fundamentals remain healthy and we expect investments to be up next year, although not as much as foundry logic. Finally, capital-intensity is also providing an important tailwind. With a deceleration of traditional Moore's Law scaling, and the transition to the new P pack T-Playbook, complexity is increasing. Simply put, more innovation is needed to get from one node to the next and its higher complexity translates to higher capital intensity. Against this backdrop, I will now describe Applied's performance and progress towards our strategic goals.In fiscal 2021, we grew semiconductor equipment revenues, almost $5 billion or 43 % year-on-year, outpacing the market growth rate during that period. However, as I described earlier, we were unable to fully meet demand in our fourth quarter due to component shortages. And we expect to remain supply constrained going into fiscal 2022. As a result, we have grown our backlog at a Company level to $11.8 billion, which is up 77 % compared to the same period last year. Our near-term results do not fully reflect the underlying strength in our business or the progress we're making against our long-term strategy.As a reminder, our strategy has three pillars. First, to be the pack T enablement Company and provide the foundation for customers ' power performance, area costs and time-to-market road maps. Second, to shift more of our business to subscriptions, and third to generate incremental free cash flows and profitable from our businesses in adjacent markets. We've aligned our organization and investments around these critical focus areas and are demonstrating strong momentum. Applied's P pack T enablement strategy is built upon 3 differentiated elements. We have the broadest and most enabling portfolio of unit process solutions. We can co-optimize and integrate these technologies in unique and highly enabling ways and we're focused on time-to-market acceleration with our AIX or actionable insight accelerator data platform.Starting with our unit process tools, demand in our traditional leadership areas is very strong. Our Epion Thermal businesses both grew 70 % this fiscal year. And CMP grew more than 60 %. In our targeted growth areas, we expect our process diagnostic and control revenues to be up more than 60 % in calendar 2021. Packaging is another very exciting area for us. Our equipment revenues are up more than 55 % year-on-year, and we're on track to exceed $800 million for calendar 2021. We're also bringing highly enabling future technologies to market through a combination of organic R&D and strategic partnerships.Moving to our co-optimized and integrated products, the customer pull for these solutions is strong, and increasing for future nodes. Co-optimization allows us to see and solve higher-value problems for customers, speed up commercialization of new innovations and capture more of the available opportunity. One example is dielectric materials, where we're driving parallel innovations in material's deposition, modification, and removal. Our CVD group has more than 15 new materials either in development or recently released. These enabled new structures or manufacturing techniques in both foundry logic and memory. The revenue opportunity we've opened up for the co-optimized etch and CMP steps is almost twice as large as the market for the standalone deposition equipment.Another example is advanced patterning, where we're co-optimizing CVD, ALD, and CMP with our Sym3 etch, enabling us to gain more than 5 points of share in patterning this year. Integrated material solutions, or IMS, go one step beyond co-optimization by combining multiple processes with customized metrology and sensors in a single system, typically under vacuum. With IMS we can target the most complex and valuable challenges in the new P pack t. playbook. For example, this year we delivered 5 new low R or low resistance metalization integrated solutions to customers that address next-generation applications in Foundrylogic, DRAM, and NAND. This included our copper barriers seed IMS that combined 7 different process technologies in one system under vacuum. ALD, PVD, CVD, copper reflow, surface treatment, interface engineering and metrology.This enables a 50 % reduction in interconnect resistance at the most advanced Foundrylogic nodes, and creates a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for Applied Materials, over the next 5 years. The final component of our PPACt enablement strategy is time-to-market acceleration. New digital tools that accelerate R&D, technology transfer, and high-volume manufacturing are a major focus area for our customers in the coming years, these technologies will have a huge impact on productivity and innovation and commercialization speed. They will also play a key role in making regional supply chains economically competitive and sustainable. Our AIX platform brings together process tools, sensors, metrology, with data analytics and machine learning. We currently have 25 AIX R&D acceleration engagements with leading customers, and we now expect that number to triple over the next 12 months.Another highlight for 2021 is the progress we're making with subscription revenues. In our service business, we've already converted a significant percentage of our spares and service revenue from on-demand to long-term service agreements. We now have nearly 15,000 installed base tools covered by these agreements up 12 % year-on-year. The tenure of these agreements has grown from 1.9 years at the end of 2020 to 2.3 years today and our renewal rate is about 90%. Several customers have highlighted how these long-term agreements have allowed them to better manage disruptions in parts supply, and technical support during the pandemic. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I will quickly summarize As the digital transformation of the economy accelerates, demand for semiconductors continues to grow and is significantly outpacing supply.We expect supply shortages of certain silicon components to persist in the near term, meaning that we don't expect to fully meet demand in Q1. Managing these constraints in partnership with our suppliers and chipmakers is our top priority. Looking beyond the near-term disruptions, I feel very positive about the future. Longer-term secular trends are driving the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher. And in Applied, we're making significant progress towards our strategic plans. We're in the best position to accelerate our customers PPACt roadmap, and grow significantly faster than our markets over the next several years. Now, I'll hand the call over to Bob.Bob HallidayThanks, Gary. I want to begin by saying I'm very happy for the opportunity to work with all of you again. I have 3 main messages today. Number 1, demand is very strong and growing. And I think it's likely to remain strong in 2022 and beyond. Number 2, supply chain constraints are impacting our ability to meet all of our demand s i n the near-term. Number 3, Applied Materials is making very good progress toward our financial targets. And we're in a great position to return capital to shareholders. I will cover each of these topics in order and give you our guidance. And then Gary, Mike and I will help with your questions. I'll begin by giving you a more detailed insight than we typically share about the demand for our products and its sustainability into 2022. Specifically, our semi systems revenue grew by 43 % in 2021.Our semi systems orders grew by 78 % for the year. In fact, our semi systems orders grew in every quarter. In Q4 they were up 136 % year over year. Looking ahead, we currently expect our orders to be higher in the first half of fiscal 2022 than in the second half of 2021 across semi-systems AGS, and also display. In short, the demand environment is very strong. What's happening on the demand side is that all of the trends Gary and I talked about years ago, are playing out an even bigger way than we imagined. First, semiconductor demand is higher because we're designing more intelligence into practically everything that gets built and sold. Second, equipment capital intensity is higher. We don't have wafer size increases anymore. And the industry has run out a number of efficiencies, including fab automation, industry consolidation, and the foundry model.Used equipment is now scarce. So even in the ICAPS markets, customers are buying new equipment and spending more. The industry is adding more wafer capacity to keep up with demand, particularly in Foundrylogic. And we believe spending will remain strong. Specifically, the industry grew Foundrylogic wafer starts by around 40 % over the past 5 years alone. At the end of our fiscal year overall fab utilization for the industry increased to the highest level of the past decade. We see FoundryLogic continuing to grow as a proportion of the industry's mix. 5 years ago, FoundryLogic represented around 53 % of WFE spending.As of 2021, it's grown to 60 % of WFE, and we see it being even higher into the future. Even with higher wafer capacity and high utilization, we have a global semiconductor shortage that's affecting a wide range of industries, including our own. Industry-wide, we are tracking 59 fab projects with available and announced expansion capacity of 3.5 million wafer starts. These projects represent potential equipment spending of around $300 billion in future years. All of this data leads me to believe that demand is likely to remain strong. Now I'll give you more insights into our own supply situation. In Q4, our semi systems backlog was at record levels and growing quickly. In our guidance for Q4, we targeted modest semi systems revenue growth. We also widened our overall guidance range due to our concerns about the supply chain. owards the end of Q4, we experienced later than expected deliveries of the components we need to complete and ship our build plan by the end of the quarter. The reason for the delays is that our suppliers couldn't get enough parts from their own suppliers, which include chipmakers and distributors. The supply issues are directly related to the semiconductor shortage, particularly in logic, power and analog ICs. Not all of our semi businesses were affected in Q4. Our process control, CMP, etch and packaging businesses beat our revenue targets.Yet our overall semi systems revenue was $293 million below the midpoint of our expectation. to full semiconductor revenue impact of the shortages during the quarter was well above $300 million. In Q1, we're guiding for sequential growth of around 3 %. We have the internal capacity to easily ship several $100 million more of semi equipment. But we're planning for a modest supply increases. Looking ahead, I believe WFE spending will be up again in calendar 2022 and will remain strong, particularly for Foundrylogic, both at the leading edge and ICAPs nodes. I also believe, Applied's business will be higher in the first-half of calendar 2022 than in the second half of calendar 2021 both in semi systems and in AGS.Next, since it's the end of our fiscal year, it's a good time to assess the progress we're making towards our 2024 financial model. In April, we outlined targets to grow our revenue, profitability, and earnings in a variety of WFE scenarios, including a base case of $85 billion and a high case of $100 billion. With everything we're seeing in the industry today, our high scenario of $100 billion is increasingly likely. 1 year into the long-term plan, we've made good progress, increasing revenue by 34 %, non-GAAP gross margin by 240 basis points, non-GAAP operating margin by 540 basis points, and non-GAAP EPS by 64 %.We believe our semi-systems group is well on track to its growth targets based on our strong product roadmaps and the deep customer engagements Gary described. We believe AGS can exceed the growth implied in our model after growing by 21 % this year alone. In fact, AGS had record backlog of over $4.33 billion at the end of the year. 72 % of the Q4 backlog was subscription business with terms of 1 to 3 years and 65 % of new subscription bookings were multiyear. While our focus is on recurring revenue, AGS also includes our 200 millimeter equipment business. Our 200-millimeter business has been growing, along with the rest of the ICAPS market, approaching $650 million in WFE revenue in calendar 2021. Turning to our profitability metrics We expect to achieve a non-GAAP gross margin target of 48.5%, once the near-term material and logistics cost headwinds subside.We also feel confident in our non-GAAP operating margin targets. The semi-systems group increased its operating margin by 590 basis points this year, while AGS delivered record operating margin of 31 % in Q4. A major focus for us is increasing the display group's margin to between 25 % and 30 %, and we plan to be in that range by the second half of 2022. Another of our targets is to return 80 % to 100 % of free cash flow to shareholders. In fiscal 2021, we generated a record $4.77 billion in free cash flow, and we returned 96 % mainly through stock buybacks.We ended the year with over $5 billion remaining in buyback authorization. And given the strong demand outlook and our view of the intrinsic value of the Company, we expect to continue to be aggressive with the program. Now I'll share our Q1 business outlook. Given the supply chain challenges, we expect to modestly increase revenue to $6.16 billion plus or minus $250 million or up around 19 % year-on-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.85 plus or minus $0.07 or up around 33 % year-on-year. Within this outlook, we expect semi-systems revenue of around $4.46 billion up 25 % year-over-year.We project AGS revenue of around $1.33 billion up 15 % year-over-year. We expect display revenue to be around $350 million in Q1 and higher as we progress through the year. Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should decline to around 47.4% primarily due to higher and near-term cost headwinds. We plan to increase non-GAAP OpEx to $970 million, which is around 15.8% of revenue, below our long-term model target of 16 %. Our guidance also assumes a 12 % non-GAAP tax rate. Finally, along with Gary, I'd like to thank all of our teams and partners for their hard work in a challenging environment. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.Michael SullivanThanks, Bob. Now to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just 1 question on today's call. If you have a second question, please re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions, you will need to press [Operator Instructions ]. Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore, you may proceed with your question.C.J. MuseYes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. And welcome back, Bob. I'm sure you're happy to be back from the golf course. So I guess a couple of part question on supply constraints. You talked about not being fully resolved in January, do you expect it to be resolved in April? And how are customers reacting to the shortages? Are they waiting on a full suite of tools or are they taking whatever tools they can get? And then, lastly, considering the backlog that you highlighted, and also that longest lead time [Indiscernible] is essentially sold out for all of 2022, it certainly looks like your visibility extends now into 2023. Can you speak to that?Bob HallidaySure. Thanks for?wovering? back. Few things. 1. Supply chain, 2. Overall demand environment, and 3. Visibility, I guess. On the first one, supply chain, we actually did pretty well managing this through about 11 months of the year and a week and then it got a little worse at the end of the quarter. And that was our issue. So now we're all over this thing. In the short-term, managing the next quarters about prioritization, project management and execution. So we have set up a cadence that every week I'm going through all the detail performance by-week of how we're doing on receipts, shipments, shortages, individual supplier names.And Gary is going through it almost every day, okay? So we are escalating this thing. So when you say, why do we think we're going to do better in Q1? If you look at some of the public companies you know, they're up 3 % to 5 % on average, some of our suppliers. We believe that our allocation will be somewhat better than that. We also believe that we have internally allocated that effectively and we're working with our suppliers, who are our customers to free up more demand. Secondly, if you look at the early data in the first 2 weeks of the quarter, receipts were up about 15 % from the previous quarter.So I think we're going to be okay. If you look at the stuff that caused us problems, there's miscellaneous problems all over the place but most of those are manageable. What hit us hard was this thousands theoretically of electronic components that our suppliers using our products to us. There were about 100 that we're closely monitoring last quarter and 10 that gave us problems at the end of the quarter. These are particularly around PLCs. We're monitoring the top 10 suppliers of our products and we are monitoring those 100 plus 200 other components. We want to make sure nothing goes bad. So I feel pretty good that number 1, the demand is really good, the backlogs is there, the orders are up every quarter.It looks strong next year, it doesn't like strong next year. I think supply chain is going to get better incrementally every quarter through the year. In terms of -- visibility is great. In terms of full suite of tools, customers are taking all the tools we can ship, and we're largely keeping them happy, but we want to not get the backlog too big, but I think we are going to make progress throughout the year.Gary DickersonHi, C.J. This is Gary. I'll add a little bit more. I've met with all the CEOs of our top customers, leading technologies, and ICAP s here in the last quarter. And what I would say certainly the supply situation is challenging, but there is really no change in terms of the customer demand for the products and some of the tools that again Bob -- as Bob said it's not a broad-based issue. Some of these tools are the ones that are most enabling from Applied and again, those -- nothing has changed relative to that demand.Michael SullivanHey, thanks C.J.C.J. MuseThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.John PitzerYes. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bob, welcome back as well. It's great working with you again. My guess is you're going to get multiples of C.J. 's questions on the supply side. But I'm just kind of curious Bob, to follow-up, as the supply chain gets better, do you think by the April quarter, there is a big step function, pick up to the 500 million plus or minus that you can't ship in October and January or will it be a little bit more linear than that as supply comes online. And then to your point earlier Bob, about the backlog, just how do you safeguard against sort of a frothy backlog in this kind of environment? They are impressive numbers but typically, when customers can't get what they want, they tend to order more than they need. So how are you safeguarding against that?Bob HallidayIn terms of rate of recovery and confidence in the backlog, a double booking question I think is the question. In terms of rate of recovery, what we're modeling from discussions with suppliers and our suppliers ' suppliers there are internal analysis which we're doing the best we can to model this and we believe it's accurate. We think Q1, the rate recovery, if you look at our semi business is up a little over 3 % equipment. And that's about what the industry is quarter-on-quarter. Our AGS business is a little bit lower because it's 14 weeks last year in Q1 as the Chinese holiday falls into Q1 this year. But if you look at rate of recovery.We think it goes up a little over 3 % in Q1, we think the equipment business picks up a couple of points more every quarter and build more momentum later in the year. Now as we get more visibility, next quarter, I'll be more confident of those numbers. But that's the kind of acceleration we're picking up in shipments. We hope to do better. We might do better, but that's what we're modeling. Doubling, I don't think that's a problem right now double booking, John. If you look a breakout between memory and the Foundrylogic, Foundrylogic was 60 % this year the business. We actually think it's up next year. If you look at public statements from TSMC Intel, another big.FoundryLogic manufacturers. They're talking about multiyear commitments to WFE spending and very strong businesses on their side. We look within the mix that FoundryLogic increases its percentage of the mix next year We look at [Indiscernible] as being slightly up, a little bit more on NAND, a little bit down on DRAM, so we think that's muted and reasonable. And we don't see double booking then. We see China down a little bit next year. So I don't see the double booking thing right now.John PitzerWe'll see at the conference.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research, you may proceed with your question.Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact of the constraints on the services business because it's not just services, there is hardware and everything else. If service is actually being impacted by constraints, would services be strong without them? And how do you think --how do you see services -- the evolution of services going forward into next year as the -- you work to resolve the constraint issue?Bob HallidayServices business is doing great. This year were up 21 %. We're ahead of plan to hit the 2024 model. I think we might have said on the call even that we need a compound rate of growth of 7 % a year to hit that model. We think we'll exceed that probably do double digits this year, growth in service. If you look at our service business, it's multiple components: there is 200 millimeter tool business, there is a contract services where you sign up for services 1 to 3 years, including different types of service arrangements, and then there is time and material stuff. If you look at the service business, we think it's going to grow strongly this year in double – strong double-digits.And in fact, our customers are thanking our service guys for getting them onto parts, service contracts in the past year or 2, because our customers are in good shape in terms of support and parts. So I think that the parts issue, supply chain issues are not really impact ing our service business. The other thing which we'll point out and Gary might give you more detail, if you look at the parts of the constrained things like PLCs and stuff which are components in components, those are not the parts that are high replacement service parts in the service supply chain. So I think we're pretty good shape on the service business and it's a great business for us.Stacy Rasgon And Bob how would you guide services in fiscal '22 as a percent? Low double-digit?Bob HallidayYeah, I think it's all double-digits growth.Stacy Rasgon Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so muchOperatorThank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.Vivek Arya Thanks for taking my q
