So, thank you Celine. Good morning and thank you for joining ST for our Q1 2021 earnings conference call. Let me begin with some opening comments, starting with Q1. So, year-over year, net revenues grew 35.2% to $3.02 billion. All product groups contributed to this growth, on continued acceleration of demand globally. Our operating margin increased to 14.6% and our net income rose 89.6% to $364 million. On a sequential basis, net revenues decreased 6.8%, 270 basis points above the mid-point of our outlook. Our gross margin was 39%, 50 basis points above the mid-point of our outlook. Our free cash flow during the first quarter was $261 million, after net capital expenditure payments of $405 million. We exited the first quarter with a net cash position at $1.19 billion. 
On Q2 2021, at the mid-point of our outlook, we expect net revenues in the second quarter to be about $2.9 billion, a year-over-year increase of about 39%. Gross margin is expected to be about 39.5%. For the full year 2021, we plan for solid revenue growth, outperforming the markets we serve. We will drive the Company based on a plan for full year 2021 revenues of about $12.1 billion, plus or minus $150 million, a year-over-year increase of 18.4% at the mid-point. This growth is expected to be driven by strong dynamics in all end markets we address and our engaged customer programs. We now plan to invest about $2.0 billion in CapEx to support the strong market demand and our strategic initiatives. This level of investment is at the high end of the range we communicated in January. 
Now, let’s move to a detailed review of the first quarter. Net revenues increased 35.2% year-over-year, with higher sales in all product groups except, as expected, the Radio Frequency Communications sub-group. Year-over-year, sales to OEMs increased 21.4% and to Distribution rose 76.2%. On a sequential basis, net revenues decreased 6.8%, 270 basis points better than the mid-point of our outlook. Automotive and Power Discrete products and Microcontrollers increased sequentially, partially offset by a decrease in Personal Electronics products. 
Gross profit was $1.18 billion, growing 38.9% on a year-over-year basis. The gross margin increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 39%, mainly due to lower unloading charges, manufacturing efficiencies and improved product mix, partially offset by negative currency effects, net of hedging. Our first quarter gross margin was 50 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance, mainly thanks to better product mix. First quarter operating margin was 14.6%, a year-over-year increase of 420 basis points, with improvements in ADG and MDG and a decrease for AMS. Net operating expenses were $735 million. Net income increased 89.6% to $364 million on a year-over-year basis and our diluted earnings per share were $0.39. 
Looking at the product group year-over-year performance, all three product groups had double-digit growth. ADG revenues increased 38.4%, on growth in both Automotive and in Power Discrete. AMS revenues increased 27.1%, on higher Analog, MEMS and Imaging product sales. MDG revenues increased 42.2%, on growth in Microcontrollers, partially offset by the expected decline in Radio Frequency Communications. By product group on a year-over-year basis, ADG operating margin increased to 8.2% from 3.0%; AMS operating margin decreased to 17.2% from 20.8%; and MDG operating margin increased to 19.4% from 11.5%. 
Net cash from operating activities increased 70.9% to $682 million in Q1, compared to $399 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow increased to $261 million compared to $113 million in the year-ago quarter with CapEx of $405 million versus $260 million in the year-ago quarter. During the first quarter, we paid $38 million of cash dividends to shareholders and we executed a $156 million share buy-back as part of our existing repurchase program. Our net financial position was $1.19 billion at April 3, 2021, compared to $1.10 billion at December 31, 2020. It reflected total liquidity of $4.16 billion and total financial debt of $2.97 billion. 
Let’s now discuss the market and business dynamics. During the first quarter, global demand continued to accelerate, following the already faster and stronger than expected restart of demand which began in Q3 2020. In Automotive, the rebound from Q4 2020 was much faster than anticipated, and it has caused supply chain constraints across the entire semiconductor industry. This rebound was, and remains, broad-based, across all customers, including distribution, and geographies, and is driven by three main factors; first, the number of cars produced; second, the replenishment of inventories across the automotive supply chain; and third, semiconductor content increase related to digitalization and electrification, as well as higher content in traditional cars driven by accessories. 
During Q1, automotive demand remained strong, with our bookings well above our current and planned manufacturing capacity. Booking visibility is now extending to about 18 months. Our customer activity related to electrification and digitalization, the long-term trends driving automotive semiconductor content increase and continued to accelerate in Q1. In car electrification, we added to our list of design wins for Silicon Carbide devices in applications such as traction inverters and onboard chargers. 
We also won a number of designs with complementary technologies such as our high voltage MOSFETs for an on-board charger and an electrical vehicles auxiliary power supply, Vertical Intelligent Power products for a battery management system, and with our 32-bit automotive microcontrollers for a traction inverter and for a battery management system. We are also winning sockets in these electric vehicle designs with our legacy automotive products for domains such as body and convenience and infotainment. 
In car digitalization, we are focused on technologies and solutions for driver assistance and autonomous driving, V2X communications, and embedded processing solutions supporting new domain controller or zone server car architectures. For example, we had additional awards for our 28 nanometer FD-SOI Phase Change Memory microcontrollers called Stellar. We won a number of designs, in addition to what I mentioned before for electric vehicles, with our 32-bit automotive MCU embedded processing solutions. All these products are designed on our own proprietary technologies and manufactured in our internal 300 millimeter wafer fab. Overall in ADAS, we continue to see an acceleration trend on Level 2 and Level 2+. 
To conclude this automotive overview, we also expanded our sensor business with automotive-grade motion sensors for global positioning modules and navigation units and we ramped a global shutter image sensor for a well-known electric vehicle car maker, the latest example of our diversification strategy in optical sensing solutions. 
Moving now to Industrial. During the quarter, we saw very strong demand, both in high-end and consumer industrial. Factory automation was one of the main demand drivers, but we also saw a similar trend for power tools, home appliances, motion control, and power-related applications, including renewable energy. Demand was strong both with Distribution as well as OEMs, in line with our approach to be broad in the highly fragmented industrial market. 
Inventories of our products at distributors are currently lean across all product families, with high inventory turns. Point-of-sales remained strong in the first quarter across all products and geographies. We address the industrial end market with our general purpose and secure MCUs, analog and sensors, power and energy management solutions. 
Our first strategic objective in Industrial is leadership in embedded processing solutions. I am glad to say that preliminary rankings for 2020 indicate that ST was number one for combined General purpose and Secure MCU revenues. To continue to lead, we are strengthening our embedded processing offer around the STM32 family in terms of wireless connectivity, security, and artificial intelligence. During the quarter, we announced a number of products and solutions supporting this strategy. 
We launched a new extreme low-power STM32 series, with advanced performance and cybersecurity features. The new devices have already won designs at major Industrial OEMs and in metering applications. We also announced new STM32 Bluetooth Low Energy devices and the first STM32 Wireless Microcontroller Module. And we introduced a new Artificial Intelligence firmware and camera-module bundle to help developers building computer-vision applications. 
Our second objective in industrial is expansion in power and energy management. Here we captured many wins with our power discrete products; for example, with Silicon Carbide and high voltage silicon MOSFETs, as well as IGBT in applications such as industrial power-supply, electrical vehicle chargers, battery-test systems, air-conditioners, home appliances and lighting. Overall, our Silicon Carbide engagements increased again during the quarter, now with 68 customers, equally split between Industrial and Automotive, in 77 ongoing programs. 
A third strategic objective is to accelerate our growth in analog and sensors for industrial. In the first quarter, we had many new designs with our analog products for industrial applications. We received awards in metering, motion control, factory automation and home appliances. We also continued to expand our business in sensors in industrial applications with design wins for motion sensors and time of flight solutions in applications like cleaning robots. 
Moving now to the Personal Electronics market. Today more than ever, smartphones are an essential source of social connection and streaming services for entertainment, fitness, gaming, and music. 5G adoption remains the main driver for smartphones growth moving forward. There is also strong demand, as we continued to see during Q1, for other connected devices including wearables, tablets, hearables, True Wireless Stereo headsets and game consoles. 
In Personal Electronics, we are progressing on our two strategic objectives; first, to lead in selected high-volume smartphone applications with differentiated products or custom solutions. Here we continued to win sockets in flagship devices with motion sensors, multi-zone time-of-flight ranging sensors, wireless charging products, touch display controllers, and secure solutions such as embedded SIM and secure elements with Near Field Communication. Our second objective is to leverage our broad portfolio to address high-volume applications such as True Wireless Stereo headsets, smart watches, bracelets and smart shoes. Here we had wins for standard and specialized motion and pressure sensors, analog and power products as well as for microcontrollers. 
We also progressed with our solutions for Augmented Reality based on Laser Scanning. The LaSAR Alliance we announced last year is now open to accept new members. We signed an agreement with a technology specialist to jointly develop ultra-compact, low-power laser-beam scanners and we demonstrated augmented reality glasses based on ST components at Mobile World Congress Shanghai. 
In Communications Equipment and Computer Peripherals, during Q1, we saw continued adoption of 5G-related products as well as a sustained demand for PCs and especially notebooks and Chromebooks, as they continue the move from being shared household devices to individual ownership. Our approach to this end market has three objectives. One is to address selected applications in cellular and satellite communication infrastructure. In this area we captured multiple radio frequency CMOS ASICs awards for telecommunication infrastructure from a new customer. 
Our other objectives are to address selected high-volume applications with differentiated products or custom solutions, and to leverage our broad portfolio. Our wins here include time-of-flight and motion sensors for laptops and Chromebooks. 
Now, let’s move to a discussion of the second quarter 2021 outlook and some comments on the full year 2021. The unexpected magnitude and speed of the upturn in semiconductor demand have put the whole supply chain under strain. Manufacturing capacity worldwide, including at foundries, is currently saturated and well below the global level of customer demand at least for the next six months and, most likely, for the full year 2021. 
ST reacted fast, fully saturating our existing manufacturing capacity with the right product mix; and, by working to increase capacity faster and above our initial operating plan in our wafer fabs, particularly for Digital/mixed signal CMOS-based and Advanced Smart Power and Silicon Carbide technologies to serve Automotive, Power and Microcontrollers. Our current and planned 2021 manufacturing capacity is fully loaded with the confirmed backlog. We are now planning for 2022. We are working closely with our customers and partners across all end-markets and channels to adapt to this unprecedented situation. 
For the second quarter, we expect net revenues to be about $2.9 billion, increasing year-over-year by about 39% at the mid-point, with, again, growth across all product groups. On a sequential basis, this translates into a sales decrease of 3.8%, at the midpoint, due to the usual seasonality in Personal Electronics. We expect the gross margin to be about 39.5%, representing a year-over-year increase of 450 basis points, mainly due to higher loading and improved efficiencies in our plants. Sequentially, this represents an increase of about 50 basis points at the mid-point. 
For the full year, we will drive the company based on a plan for full year 2021 revenues of about $12.1 billion, plus or minus $150 million. With this plan, which translates into year-over-year growth of 18.4% at the mid-point, we expect to outperform the markets we serve. This growth is expected to be driven by strong dynamics in all end markets we address and our engaged customer programs. We now plan to invest about $2.0 billion in CapEx to support the strong market demand this year 2021 but next year 2022 as well and our strategic initiatives. 
To conclude; on Q1, ST showed its ability to adjust to the strong and sudden upswings in semiconductor demand which started in Q3 last year and accelerated in Q4 and Q1. We did that working alongside our customers and partners and pursuing our objectives with the diversified and balanced approach across end markets that is at the heart of our strategy. We continued to focus on customers, adapting our investments to increase our manufacturing capacity to support the higher level of global semiconductor demand and our engaged customers programs. We maintained our financial strength, as demonstrated by our operating profitability and cash flow generation. 
For 2021, we will drive the company based on a plan for FY21 revenues of $12.1 billion, plus or minus $150 million. We also plan to invest about $2.0 billion in CapEx, not only to increase our manufacturing capacity to support the strong global market demand, including engaged customers programs. As an example, for this year, we are preparing another expansion of Crolles to prepare next year of 2022, but, also, to continue to run our manufacturing strategic initiatives in order to enable our future growth. As an expectation, we will deliver production wafer for Agrate 300 by end of next year.
On this accelerated revenue growth path, we will continue to make ST stronger, determined to achieve our strategic objectives by leveraging our balanced markets position, our focus on high growth applications and our solid product/IP Technology portfolio. All these are well supported by ST’s unique internal manufacturing infrastructure, with our teams executing with discipline and flexibility, now more important than ever under these market dynamics. 
Celine Berthier
Thank you, Lorenzo. Before we open the floor to questions, let me add few words on our upcoming Annual General Meeting. So our 2021 AGM will be on May 27. As usual, all related materials are available on investor relations part of the ST corporate website. As part of the resolution submitted for the approval of shareholders, ST supervisory board is proposing a dividend of [indiscernible] per share, so back to the pre-COVID levels. If you'll recall, last year, taking into account the global, social and economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, the dividend was decreased to [indiscernible] per share. And as I submitted resolution, I am happy to highlight is the reappointment of Jean-Marc Chery as third member of the managing board and CEO for another three-year term. 
With this, we are happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alexander Peterc from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
Alexander Peterc
Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Can I just explore a little bit the upside and downside on your current year revenue forecast of 12.1 billion. So we see shortages propagating from auto into smartphones and other industries, as you've pointed out. Do you see any risk that if production is held back at your key clients, that that could have a negative impact on your overall outlook for the year? And then on the upside, you would have obviously books for the year. Are there any disabilities for you to exceed this forecast? Can you increase or accelerate any CapEx plans at all or are we basically really pretty much at capacity? And then just as a point of maintenance and could you give us an outlook for your CMD? What kind of format will we have in the calendar for this year, and second, mainly on OpEx where do you see it in the second quarter? Thanks a lot.
Celine Berthier
So three questions, so we will start with the plus one [ph].
Jean-Marc Chery
Can you rephrase a bit?
Celine Berthier
So the first one is a $12.1 million up and down which is range we worked, there could be some down driven by some change in the profile of the model. I reiterate, Alex, and tell me if I'm wrong, and also if there is any flexibility during the year or two? Is there any up and down to historical $1 billion? 
Jean-Marc Chery
I assume the case, the plus or minus $150 million is basically the usual and standard uncertainty when you provide a such plan related to random event in the operation. But I guess everybody who are aware about what happened in Texas with snowstorm and what happened, okay, in Japanese competitor and fire, in fact. So, okay, with this kind of random event, okay, you have to resize it. Okay. So, the range of plus minus 150 million are only related to random event on the operation, absolutely not related to demand, which again is well, well above a our manufacturing plant capacity. 
Celine Berthier
So second question was if we have any plan for our Capital Market Day next year or if we do anything there?
Jean-Marc Chery
For this year? 
Celine Berthier
Yes.
Jean-Marc Chery
For this year, we have not yet planned. We will be planning to during the course of the year.
Alexander Peterc
Okay. And OpEx?
Celine Berthier
And on OpEx?
Jean-Marc Chery
No, I don’t.
Lorenzo Grandi
Maybe I take a question about OpEx. Good morning to everybody. If I well understand the question was on OpEx in Q2, how to model the OpEx in Q2. In Q2, we see our expenses has slightly declined compared to the one of Q1. Actually, the expenses in Q1 came a little bit higher than expected; while in Q2, we substantially, let’s say, think the effects will stay similar to the one of Q1, slightly maybe down but not significantly where we have a more favorable calendar and maybe a little bit more favorable effects. But these will be substantially offset by increase in activities. And don't forget that in the second quarter, we have, let’s say, the salary policies, so increase in terms of cost of labor.
Alexander Peterc
Thank you very much.
Celine Berthier
Thank you, Alex. Next question, please, Moira. 
Operator
The next question is from Dominik Olszewski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dominik Olszewski
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one's really just to follow up on the previous question. So does that imply that your sort of view on upside potential in the second part of the year because you're fully booked is more limited or what are the puts and takes on sort of that view on the second half? And then the second question is or the follow up is just around the mix of revenues that you're expecting for 2021? Thank you
Jean-Marc Chery
No, for the full year, again -- 
Dominik Olszewski
Yes by division.
Jean-Marc Chery
By division?
Celine Berthier
[indiscernible]. The first one was on H2 limited by capacity. And the second question is what is the mix of revenue for the year? 
Jean-Marc Chery
Okay, so he let Lorenzo to answer on the mix. 
Lorenzo Grandi
Well, let's say when we look at the growth in respected 2020 by group, definitely we see that that in our expectation of the $12.1 million midpoint that all groups are contributing. For sure the groups that are contributing more is ADG with a significant growth. Also, based on the fact that last year, let's say, especially in the first part of the ADG was impacted by not a particularly stronger marketing in automotive. This year is the opposite. So definitely ADG will be the driver of the growth followed by MDG. MDG for sure is impacted by the fact that in industrial there is a stronger rebound in the market and our distribution, as you have already seen in Q1, is much stronger, let's say, than it was last year. So the second driver will be, definitely MDG. And when we look at AMS, AMS last year had a stronger year, definitely will increase, will continue on the path of growth, let's say, at the less pace, lower pace, in compared to the other two groups. I will say all of these three groups will contribute. First one, ADG, strong growth; MDG will be significant growth; and also AMS will continue to grow significantly, let's say, a contributing to the overall growth of the company.
Jean-Marc Chery
Yeah and for the second half and the full year, we can be at the upper range of what we mentioned. Assuming, okay, we execute 100% effectively of all the operation we have set up okay. I already said but I would like to record again that our population are working 24 hour a day, seven day a week, all the live location, so we have absolutely no holding in our supply chain. And if we deliver it up to the last minute of 2021, we could be at the range of 12.1 plus or minus whenever 150 means [indiscernible].
Dominik Olszewski
Thank you.
Celine Berthier
Thank you very much. Next question please Moira. 
Operator
The next question is from Stephane Houri from ODDO. Please go ahead.
Stephane Houri
Yes. Hello. Good morning everyone. So, the first question and I have a follow up is can you -- now that you gave some visibility for the rest of the year, your vision of your relationship with your largest customers or customer, not customers, in the second half? And can you clarify in terms of content and if you see sales growing with this customer and as I said, I have a follow up after. Thank you
Jean-Marc Chery
Well, okay, so, this is an interesting question, okay. But what I would like to speak about, let’s say, personal electronics okay. Clearly now, about ST, we are okay in all the platform of the main players in personal electronics because okay we are executing our strategic objective, okay. What I would like to recall, okay, with custom solution, we addressed selectively some, let's say, high volume application out of the core digital of smart devices. And on another line, okay, we leveraged our general purpose portfolio to capture, let's say, accessories, okay, inside the smart device, high volume application as well. And I take this opportunity to note, okay, that with our broad range portfolio, clearly we play in multitude device everywhere with major player. And this has enabled us to engage in many important customer programs around the world and which for us, again is essential to remain a key supplier in this space, personal electronics segment. Now, more specifically, our custom products that address selectively complex applications in the personal electronics segment played to our strength. If we look at the typical design cycle time for this complex application, I can confirm that we have a clear visibility on where ST products will remain a part of such application for the current three years and will contribute to our revenue growth.
Stephane Houri
Okay. So just to clarify, you can confirm for the current year or years?
Jean-Marc Chery
Three years.
Stephane Houri
Three years, okay. Okay, and then the follow up piece is, now that you have reached the 12 billion in 2021, while you postponed that target from 2022 to 2023. So I understand the end demand has been much stronger than expected but can you clarify if the 15 billion aspiration, I would say, that you talked about in the recent past can become your next target. Thank you.
Jean-Marc Chery
No, I will like to come to the 12 billion. Basically, we share altogether two important change versus, let's say, last December or November. Last point, now the SAM we are facing, so our specific addressable market, in absolute value is a one which was supposed to be in 2023 a few months ago. So, first of all, the absolute value of the SAM, we are facing now, either one was supposed to be in 2022, okay, and the company has demonstrated its capability to fast react in order to address it. Then, what is important to take note is that the m
