Peter Andrew
Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David Goeckeler
Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. To start, our second quarter results were at or above the upper end of guidance ranges we provided in October. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69. These results reflect continued growth in retail in what was a seasonally strong quarter.
In addition, stronger demand for our client SSD products as well as our notebook and desktop hard drives contributed to upside in revenue. We continue to work hard delivering for our shareholders, customers, partners, and communities. We adapted to changes in our business and continue to manage the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic.
Our results reflect the benefits of having such a diverse and deep product portfolio, fantastic franchises, a vast customer base, and now an optimized organizational structure. As a result, we have a solid foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in front of us.
I'm excited about the progress we've made over the last few months in the recently established Flash and HDD business units. Both franchises are led by exceptional leaders who are highly focused on executing their respective strategies by establishing their teams, evaluating technology and product development, engaging with customers, and analyzing and effectively capturing target end markets.
As we've highlighted in previous earnings calls, we are committed to delivering on our product roadmap, including advancing our product transitions. Notably, we are making great headway with the product transitions of our energy-assisted hard drives and enterprise SSDs. As you all know, these transitions are multi-quarter journeys, but I'm pleased with our progress, which I'll detail shortly.
Although our progress to date is showing tangible results, there's still work to be done. We remain extremely focused on enhancing our ability to drive continued innovation and sustainable long-term shareholder value.
Let me now provide a recap of our Flash and HDD businesses. Within Flash, we remain well positioned to address the digital transformation driven by businesses, schools and consumers that continue to leverage technology as a daily necessity for work, learning and a much needed form of entertainment. The pandemic has not only accelerated this transformation by the way we all use the cloud, but it has spurred technological innovation by driving the ability to access the cloud using very powerful and advanced end devices.
The increasingly pervasive ability to access, store and share data from anywhere on any device has resulted in robust storage demand, particularly in smaller form factors, such as notebook, tablet and Chromebook. The attach rate of client SSDs into notebooks now exceeds 80%, while desktop penetration of client SSDs is around 40%.
Furthermore, tablets and Chromebooks, which are all-flash based, represent a growing percentage of total PC demand. Our leading position in client NVMe-based SSDs and our strong relationships with the major PC OEMs drove our client SSD business to a record level of exabyte shipments.
Retail continued to perform well in a seasonally strong quarter, and we achieved a two-year high in revenue, supported by the strength of our brand and the breadth of our portfolio. We continue to make progress with our second-generation enterprise SSD products, completing nearly 150 qualifications. Importantly, we completed the qualification process at one cloud titan, which was an objective we committed to last quarter.
We are shipping to this cloud titan in the fiscal third quarter. The second-generation enterprise SSD qualification process is well underway with additional cloud titans and large OEMs.
From a technology perspective, we began shipping our 112 layer BiCS5 technology and client SSD products in the December quarter. BiCS5 remains the most capital-efficient technology node in the recent history of NAND going back to the 2D era, and we are preparing for a significant ramp of this node through 2021.
Ultimately, customers want the best product that offers a blend of cost, performance and power, and Western Digital provides that. Our focus on technological and architectural innovations, coupled with the benefits of size and scale that we have with our joint venture with Kioxia, has enabled us to deliver the industry's highest bit density per layer at the lowest cost per bit.
As the result of our inherent advantages with the joint venture, particularly our scale and consistent track record of technological innovation, we are able to deliver the required bit growth and performance with the lowest capital intensity in the industry. We are highly confident in our ability to continue this momentum as we ramp BiCS5 through calendar year 2021 and begin BiCS6 productization.
On the HDD side of the business, upside demand in PC, notebook and smart video more than offset weakness in capacity enterprise. The persisting work-from-home and distance learning trends I touched upon earlier, drove higher demand for both desktop and notebook, PC, hard drives and propelled retail hard drive revenue to a three-year high. The smart video business continue to recover, growing 30% sequentially. The biggest HD update is our solid progress against the initiatives we outlined last quarter, completing the qualification process at the cloud titans with our mass market energy-assisted hard drives.
I'm pleased to share that we have now completed qualifications at three of the four U.S. cloud titans. While one now completed cloud titan qualification slipped beyond our anticipated timeline in the fiscal second quarter, another cloud titan qualification scheduled to complete in the fiscal third quarter was completed in the second quarter. With these significant milestones now behind us, we have staged products in anticipation of the ramp of these drives as we continue through 2021.
With cloud digestion abating and the stabilization of OEM demand, we believe the demand in capacity enterprise bottomed in the fiscal second quarter and are anticipating a rebound in the fiscal third quarter. 18-terabyte is expected to be our leading capacity point as we head into the second-half of the calendar year, which should propel nice growth in this segment going forward. As the volume of these drives continues to ramp through the calendar year, we expect our revenue and gross margin to recover.
Before I turn it over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize our perspective on what's to come. We continue to deal with the far-reaching effects of the pandemic and no one can be certain of what the new normal will look like. However, there is no question the accelerated digital transformation has only increased the reliance on data and technology in both our professional and our personal lives, which we are confident will have a lasting impact for years to come.
To this point, some industry analysts are raising the possibility that in certain portions of the market, such as the cloud, the storage industry will not be able to meet the extraordinary demand for both flash and hard drive solutions over the course of the next 10 years. Western Digital's unique ability to provide flash and hard drive storage solutions for customers spanning individual consumers to cloud titans, highlights the value and importance of our broad portfolio and strong competitive position.
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to share details on our financial results.
Bob Eulau
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were at/or above the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Revenue was $3.9 billion, up slightly sequentially, and down 7% year-over-year. Growth in Client Devices and Client Solutions was mostly offset by a decline in our Data Center Devices & Solutions end market.
Looking at our end markets. Client Devices revenue was $2.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Work, school and game from home trends continue to drive demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions for notebook and desktop applications.
In notebook and desktop, our flash and hard drive revenue each grew over 20% sequentially, highlighting the power and value of our portfolio for our leading OEM customers.
Demand for our smart video hard drive was much stronger than expected, growing 30% sequentially as demand continued to recover from the bottom set in fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 during the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. And lastly, Mobile revenue was down sequentially, with growth in recently introduced 5G phones offset by dynamics within China.
Moving on to Data Center Devices & Solutions, revenue was $807 million, down 29% sequentially and 46% from 1 year ago. Revenue from both capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs were down sequentially. As Dave mentioned, we had an unexpected delay in a qualification at a cloud titan. As a result, during the quarter, our capacity enterprise drive shipments were negatively impacted and inventory grew. We have since completed this qualification.
And as Dave noted, given that a separate cloud titan qualification was completed ahead of schedule, we now have 3 of the 4 cloud titan qualified on our new energy-assisted drives. In addition, we are beginning to ramp our second-generation enterprise SSD products through calendar year 2021.
Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $1 billion, up 19% sequentially and 6% from a year ago. The work, school and gaming from home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products, again, highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel.
Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments were up 7% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year.
On a sequential basis, total exabyte shipments were up 2%, and while the average price per hard drive decreased 8% to $73. As we move into cost and expenses, please note that all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 26.4%, up slightly sequentially and above the upper end of the guidance range provided in October. Our Flash gross margin was up 0.7 points from the last quarter to 27.1% as the mix shifted toward our client SSDs and we experienced a strong seasonal quarter in client solutions. We continued to achieve solid cost reductions.
Our hard drive gross margin was 25.6%, down 0.6 points sequentially. The mix shift towards notebook and desktop hard drives and the early ramp of our energy-assisted drives pressured our gross margin. This includes COVID-related impact of approximately $32 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, above our guidance range.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $425 million, and free cash flow was $149 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement with a cash outflow of $276 million.
In the fiscal second quarter, we paid off $248 million in debt, including an optional debt paydown of $150 million and $35 million of the remaining SanDisk convertible notes.
Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and our gross debt outstanding was $9.3 billion. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.9 times in the second quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.5 billion, flat sequentially, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7 times.
As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.
Moving on to our outlook. Our fiscal third quarter guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.05 billion, and we expect both HDD and flash revenue to be in a similar range in the third quarter, as they were in the second. This range is better-than-expected when you consider normal seasonality, which would have implied a 7% decrease sequentially in the third quarter.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. We expect flash gross margin to improve sequentially, as we anticipate flash price declines will improve from the fiscal second quarter and cost reductions will continue.
Hard drive gross margin is expected to be down sequentially, primarily due to higher volumes of our 16-terabyte drive and a planned reduction in production volume. We expect the 18-terabyte drive to be the leading capacity point as we head into the second half of the calendar year, which should propel growth in this segment going forward.
We expect operating expenses to be between $705 million and $725 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $70 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% in the third quarter, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 and $0.75 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 310 million fully diluted shares.
Now I'll turn it back over to Dave.
David Goeckeler
Thanks, Bob. As we discussed, Western Digital has worked hard to position ourselves to address this unabated growth in data and therefore, storage technology. And thanks to these efforts, the market has aligned favorably for us.
We're running two industry-leading technology franchises in end markets that will only continue to grow as the digital transformation further accelerates. We know that our HDD business is less encumbered by workload mix shifts today and that our flash business is becoming more and more driven by applications. We also have made the right investments and our joint ventures with Kioxia are a strategic differentiating asset.
It is an extremely exciting time for our company as we are focused on capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Accordingly, we will continue building momentum behind our business unit strategies, company positioning, strong brand and industry leading fully portfolio.
I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of on the nearline hard disk drive market, I know that you talked about some puts and takes with regard to qualification cycles on the 18-terabytes. But I guess the question first of all is can you help us understand what capacity shipments did in the quarter for nearline?
And just help us understand the kind of the shape of the ramp that you expect on nearline as far as capacity shift over the next quarter, a couple of quarters, which – however, you want to kind of discuss your expectations on APTV's ramping going forward? Thank you.
David Goeckeler
Yes, I would say -- thanks, Aaron. So, I would say the mix last quarter was still 14, 16 for the most part. Of course, there are some 18s mixed in there. But as we said, one of big calls that we were working on kind of finished right in the first week of the following quarter. So, we expect that now to start ramping.
I think, as I said in the remarks, I think cloud digestion is abating. So, there -- I think the different big players come out of it at different rates. And the first ones are already starting to come out and we expect other ones to pick up as we go through the year. So, the big thing for us is we expect 18 to -- as we get into the middle part of the year, that's where the transition will happen at being the leading capacity point for us. And as that happens, that's good for our business. So, that's basically how we see it.
Aaron Rakers
And what did capacity shipments during the quarter?
David Goeckeler
Bob, do you have the capacity shipment for the quarter?
Bob Eulau
Well, I mean, we don't split it out specifically, but you can see that on the Data Center Devices & Solutions, we were down quite a bit and that was driven both by the capacity enterprise as well as enterprise SSD.
Aaron Rakers
Okay. Thank you.
Bob Eulau
Sure.
David Goeckeler
Thanks, Aaron.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
David Goeckeler
Hey, Joe.
Joe Moore
Great. Thank you. Thanks for letting me ask the question. In terms of the NAND gross margins, the improvement that you saw in the December quarter sequentially with prices down 6% like-for-like and the improvement that you're seeing in Q1, where is that coming from? And can you remind us where you are with the start-up expenses from the new fab rolling off?
David Goeckeler
Yes. So, I'd say, kind of as we started talking about last quarter, in the more transactional markets, we're seeing pricing get better. We -- we'll see how that flows through to the negotiated markets over the next couple of quarters. But basically, as we went through the quarter, we saw retail and parts of the channel improve. And as far as K1 costs?
Bob Eulau
Yes, I can update you on K1. So, I think I had originally guided to around $50 million in K1 startup costs this quarter and we actually came in around $40 million. And this quarter, the quarter we're now in, will be at normal production volume. So, we're not going to continue reporting start-up costs because we're really not in start-up mode anymore.
Joe Moore
Great. Thank you. And then in terms of your inventory level, I think you said that the inventory increase was mostly on the drive side. Where are you in terms of your internal NAND inventory?
Bob Eulau
The flash inventory is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We're not -- we haven't really built inventory on the Flash side. We really, as we mentioned in our remarks, really build some inventory in anticipation of the new drive – the new capacity enterprise drives shipping, and that's going to start higher and higher volumes as we go forward.
Joe Moore
Great. Thanks so much.
David Goeckeler
Thanks, Joe.
Bob Eulau
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
David Goeckeler
Hi, there.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the color on the data center side. I was wondering, just given your comments around the qualification timing, can this segment grow in fiscal second-half versus fiscal second-half of 2020, especially given that the comps sort of get tougher by the end of the fiscal year? And your comments on HDD gross margins sort of worsening sequentially, is this basically – are we waiting for one more quarter, basically the end of the fiscal year before we see HDD margins pick up as you get material pickup in AT&T? Or will these cloud sort of abatement plus the OEM pickup help by your fiscal fourth quarter? Thank you.
David Goeckeler
Okay. Let me see if I can decompose that a little bit. So yes, we expect a pickup in – as we move throughout the year. I think your call on the gross margin – we see the revenue coming back as we move into next quarter and then getting better throughout the year. We kind of guide one quarter at a time.
I don't have the year-over-year number on the top of my head. But you're right on margin. We kind of expect one more quarter of maybe flat to slightly down margin on the drive side, and then we'll start to see that accelerate, especially as we move through into higher percentage of AT&Ts.
Wamsi Mohan
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
David Goeckeler
Hey, Toshiya.
Toshiya Hari
Hey, thanks. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on gross margins in your ECD business, David. So again, as you mentioned, this quarter is going to be flat to down. As you move forward with mix improving, hopefully, COVID costs abating at some point, maybe some of the costs related to energy assist going away. Do you think getting back to 30% over the next year or so is a reasonable target? Or is the margin profile structurally different today versus a year ago, two years ago? Thank you.
David Goeckeler
No. I think you hit on the issues there. I mean, first of all, COVID hit last quarter was about 1.7% of a headwind in that business. In mix, we talked about retail being multi-year high. But we believe as we get – we go into 18, we have a path back to the kind of margin profile you're talking about. We just need to get the mix better.
I mean COVID's a bit of a wildcard. How fast the – it's really the freight costs, how fast we can get freight costs to come down. It's been obviously pretty sticky about where it's been for the last couple of quarters. And then as I said, as we move into 18 and we see the cloud digest – fully come out of cloud digestion, I think, you'll see a path back to the more traditional margin structure.
Toshiya Hari
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. On the Flash side, can you please provide some color as to what percentage of flash revenue were driven from gaming? And how do you see that trending for the rest of the year? And I have a follow-up.
David Goeckeler
Yes. Gaming is still -- I think it's not as significant as it was last quarter, given last quarter, there was a lot of buy in anticipation of the initial builds. So, I would say it's down a little bit sequentially, but it's still a great market for us because we can play the console side of it and the retail with WD Black, which has been very, very well-received in the retail channels. It is part of the reason, the retail business is doing well, and the margins are good as we're investing in brand in addition to just the product. So sequentially down a little bit, but still expected to be a good market as we move throughout the year.
Mehdi Hosseini
Gotcha. And then one additional follow-up on the flash side. Last earning conference call, you alluded to the fact that you are a couple of quarters away from finalizing contracts with OEMs and as prices or supply demand at Titans, do you see OEMs stepping up and signing longer term contracts, or is this just going to be a guesswork as to how they plan for, especially like one or two quarters out?
David Goeckeler
Yes. I think what I talked about last quarter was actually a qualification at the OEMs and that's a multi-quarter activity. The pricing is negotiated on a quarterly basis, and there's a long-term agreement of, let's say, on a year timeframe of what the target share is, but that can move around a little bit. But that gives you a sense about how the market works.
Mehdi Hosseini
But how do you see the dynamics like today compared to like October conference call?
David Goeckeler
Of which part, the call, or the share, or the pricing?
Mehdi Hosseini
Well, the qualification and how I think as you look into remainder of the year, do you see more of a pricing power coming back to the suppliers, or is it still going to be a hard negotiation?
David Goeckeler
Well, I mean -- so the qualification was all about our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product, which is quite a mouthful. But that qualification -- I think last quarter, I said we were scheduled to start a qualification this quarter.
I said in October, we were scheduled to start qualification in our fiscal second quarter, which did start and is underway. And that is a multi-quarter process. And assuming it's successful, put us in a stronger position to ship that product into the OEM -- into the big OEM. So it's underway.
As I said in the prepared remarks, and I think I've been talking about now for a couple of quarters. The qualification in my book is the last phase of the development process. It can move around a little bit. But the fact that it's underway is a good sign for -- we're working to expand the TAM of that product.
Mehdi Hosseini
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. A question on the NAND side. Can you speak to what's driving the better than seasonal demand in Q1? And then beyond March, how are you thinking about changes in your mix? And what impact that will have on your gross margins? Thank you.
David Goeckeler
So I'll take -- I'll give you a perspective, and share Bob's perspective as well. So we've been talking about retail for several quarters now. It's been good. The team has been doing a great job launching new products. I talked about WD Black in the gaming segment, ArmorLock, security and enterprise SSD, so lot of really good work there.
And so that continue -- we expect that there's momentum there, let me put it that way. PC, notebook demand, we still see as being strong. And we talked about what I think was a significant milestone for us this past quarter was finishing the qualification of our second-generation NVMe enterprise SSD product at one of the cloud titans. And that fin
